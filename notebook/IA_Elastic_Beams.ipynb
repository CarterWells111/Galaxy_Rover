Once the radius of the wheel is known, its *true* curvature can be found using Eqn 2. The curvature gauge is zeroed on a flat surface (the flat block) and then the *calibration* curvature reading is taken on the wheel (again, this is read out in the experiment video). Several curvature gauges can be seen above the wheel, on the flat block. How the gauge works is explained in the video.\n",

Remember that $W\\approx50\\mathrm{N}$. Consider equilibrium of the free body by taking moments about the cut, to find $M$ at the cut. Throughout this analysis we will assume that $s\\approx x$, where $x$ is the *horizontal* distance along the beam (recall that $s$ is measured *along* the curve). **Use the sign convention in the Structures Data Book**, which has been followed in the figure below. Scan in and include one or two of these free body diagrams in your write-up, if you like. Note that $M$ varies linearly with $s$ (or $x$) between the (point) forces; and so $M$ need only be calculated at a few of the stations, and the rest can be interpolated. Enter your values for $M$ at the $14$ stations into the Google Sheet.\n",

We take $Δs = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}=$ the spacing between stations. Since the \"simplified\" $\\kappa$ plot is linear, using the average curvature from one station to the next would give the exact area under the curve: $κ_{\\mathrm{mean}} = (\\kappa_n + \\kappa_{n+1})/2$, where $\\kappa_n$ and $\\kappa_{n+1}$ are the curvatures at two adjacent stations. We can then evaluate $Δψ = κ_{\\mathrm{mean}} × Δs$ (before the integration/summation), which gives the area of the trapezium under the curve between the two stations of interest, and hence we can see why we have the grey cells in the Google Sheet - due to $\\kappa_\\mathrm{mean}$ being the average between two adjacent stations. Make sure to use your \"simplified\" $\\kappa$ values in these calculations. Work on the Google Sheet, but also check a few values manually with a calculator.

We can now do this for our beam - start at midspan, where $\\psi=0$, and sum first towards the right-hand end of the beam and then towards the left. Again, use the Google Sheet to do this, also checking a few numbers manually. Note that we want to achieve $\\psi_{n+1} = \\psi_n + \\Delta\\psi_{n,n+1}$.

        "To finish this lab, you'll write an individual report, using a word processor of your choosing. Alternatively, you may hand write your report if you wish, but you then need to scan it in to submit it to Moodle. Consider the following points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The report should begin with **Title**, **date** (of your lab slot), **Summary** (write this *last*) and **Introduction**. The summary is a synopsis of the whole report, including conclusions. It should consist of about five carefully thought-out sentences.\n",
        "2. The report should be *concise*: the marker will only have 5 minutes in which to read it. This means it should be no more than 4 sides of A4 in total (including graphs, etc). It's up to you how you split the space between text and figures, but a good balance between the two is advised.\n",
        "3. For the sections **Apparatus**, **Method** and **Setup** write little and then refer to the relevant sections in this Colab notebook. Don't waste space explaining the experiment in detail. However, your report should be standalone, so you should still include a short summary of these sections, do not simply just refer to the Colab notebook.\n",
        "4. **Results**, **Observations** and **Calculations**.  Think about how best to present these sections for this experiment.  Although the various steps which were taken in the experiment are set out in this Colab notebook, you will need to write short paragraphs about some of the items in order to make your record complete. Word processing calculations and equations can be time consuming, scanned in hand calculations are sufficient.\n",
        "5. After you’ve plotted your graphs in this notebook, you can right click on any of them and “Save as”. It’s up to you which graphs you include in your report. If you're comfortable with Python, you may choose to make your graphs more fancy, which is welcome, but not required, and the default graphs plotted by the code provided are sufficient. If you would like to include the table of data from the Google Sheet, put this in an Appendix.\n",
        "6. You should also calculate the *calibration factor* of the curvature gauge. Note the calibration reading found using the large wheel (this is read out in the Experiment video), and finish with a statement that the curvature gauge gives a reading \"X% higher/lower than the true curvature\" (to 2 s.f.). Would you say this gauge is accurate?\n",
        "7. If you do this lab after the lecture about the calculation of $B = EI$, you could make an independent check on the value of $B$. The beam is made of Aluminium alloy (hint: use the Structures data book, not Materials), and you should take the thickness of the beam as $4.63\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and the width as $40\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ when calculating $I$. Note that in the calculation of $M$ (leading to the experimental value of $B$), we approximated $W=5\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{N}$, and so gravitational acceleration was taken as $g = 10\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, compared to the actual numerical value of $9.81$.\n",
        "8. In relation to the method used to find the experimental beam rotation, $\\psi$, and beam deflection, $y$, in Part III of this notebook, you should have a short section on *numerical integration*, in which you explain the method concisely. Remember we used the symmetry of the beam to find where $\\psi=0$, ultimately obtaining the deflections; what if there was no condition of symmetry, e.g. an asymmetric load - could you still get to the deflections for a non-symmetric case? Hint: think about analytical intergration, and that we need two boundary conditions when integrating twice, but for the symmetric case we technically had three - the slope being $0$ at midspan and both the supports having $0$ displacement. Also check that, given $y$, you could get back to $\\psi$ and $\\kappa$ by differentiation.\n",
        "9. Under **Discussion** you should make a comparison of the deflection at a particular point on the beam (a) as computed in the Google Sheet from the measured curvatures and (b) as measured directly. Are the measured curvatures accurate? Is measuring and validating the deflection at just one point good enough? If you could do the experiment yourself, how many points would you measure using the displacement gauge? Do you expect much to change if you make a correction for the calibration factor of the curvature gauge (above)? If you're not sure, try it!\n",
        "10. You should include under **Discussion** a short section on *sources of error* in the experiment. As you have not done the experiment yourself, use your best judgement from the Experiment video. No statistics, please; just common-sense remarks. Note that the errors in this particular experiment are very small (order of $1\\%$), so these comments should be very brief (c.f. the Structural Design Course where the collapse load is often $30\\%$ different from expected value). Hint: if you are thinking about whether the self-weight of the beam and/or the curvature gauge would cause an error, remember that we subtracted away the initial curvatures. Considering this, do you think the self-weights would affect the results?\n",
        "11. Some additional related topics you might like to discuss, if you have space left in your 4 pages: a) can we do these integrations analytically? Consider the discontinuous slopes of functions to be integrated. b) The Structures Data Book indicates that, for a given point load, the deflection of a beam $\\propto$ (span)$^3$. Can you explain from the integrations in the current analysis where this power of three comes from?\n",
        "12. Your **Conclusions** section should be brief: state your conclusions clearly.\n",
        "13. You may wish to include this Colab notebook as an **Appendix**, by providing a link to it at the end of your report. Any Appendices do not count towards your 4 pages, but bear in mind that the marker will not read them in detail.\n",
